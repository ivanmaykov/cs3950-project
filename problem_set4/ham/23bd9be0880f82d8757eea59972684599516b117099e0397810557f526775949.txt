Hey Carl,

Yup, we've been having trouble with the new hires too.  They basically know how to summarize a google search, read a wikipedia article, put stuff into chatgpt, etc., but they don't seem motivated to learn our processes and get any real work done.  That'll change, though, we've got a training program so we can develop them into the kind of leaders we need for the future.  Let's chat next week, I'll tell you more about it, maybe you can get involved.
