Hi Alex, Meg, and Lodi,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to address the recent discussions about activities in the coffee room. It seems there might be some confusion, and I'd like to provide some clarity on the matter.

I understand there have been reports about disruptive behavior in the coffee room. However, I want to assure you that my recent tooth loss has nothing to do with any activities in that space. In fact, I've been meeting with a group on the 7th floor of the parking garage for some exercise sessions.

The coffee room is not large enough for the type of activities we've been engaging in, and I believe there may be some confusion with another group. There are several organizations and teams in the office, including the Yoga Enthusiasts, the Knitting Club, and the Cooking Crew, who may be using shared spaces for various purposes.

I thought it was essential to clarify this, as I want to ensure we maintain a positive and transparent atmosphere in the workplace. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,

Sleve
