Hi Umpire Preston,

I hope this note finds you well. I'm Gus, the player involved in the recent play at second base. I wanted to bring up a quick question about the call where I was deemed out.

After taking another look at the play, I believe there might have been a misunderstanding, and I respectfully ask for your reconsideration of the call. I recognize the challenges of making split-second decisions on the field, and I appreciate your efforts in officiating the game.

If you could spare a moment to revisit the play and share your perspective, it would be extremely helpful. Given the impact on the game, I'm hoping to hear back within the next five minutes, if possible.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Gus
