Hi Brianna,

I hope this email finds you well. Recently, there have been some concerning incidents in the coffee room, and I wanted to discuss them with you directly. There have been reports of disruptive behavior and activities that I find hard to believe, and I wanted to give you an opportunity to address these concerns.

Rumors have circulated about an underground boxing club meeting in the coffee room, and I wanted to inquire whether there is any truth to these allegations. I find it important to have an open and honest conversation about the environment we are trying to foster in our shared spaces.

If you could shed some light on these matters or share your perspective, I would greatly appreciate it. It's crucial for us to work together to maintain a professional and respectful workplace for everyone.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Meg
