Dear Knitting Club Members,

I hope this email finds you well. As the president of our beloved Knitting Club, I am reaching out to discuss a necessary change in our meeting location.

It has recently come to my attention that the coffee room, where we have been enjoying our knitting sessions, is currently experiencing increased demand and utilization by other groups. One such group, the Boxing Club, has claimed the 7th floor of the parking garage for their activities, leaving us with the need to find an alternative space for our knitting sessions.

I understand the importance of having a comfortable and spacious area for our creative pursuits, and I want to ensure that our club members can continue their knitting projects without any disruptions. Therefore, I kindly ask for your cooperation in exploring and suggesting potential locations for our future meetings.

If you have any ideas or preferences, please feel free to share them with the group. Additionally, let me know if you would like to schedule a brief meeting to discuss this matter further and decide on the most suitable alternative.

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work together to ensure the smooth continuation of our Knitting Club activities.

Best regards,

John Johnson
President, Knitting Club
