In light of unforeseen challenges and to ensure we stay on track, we are exploring the possibility of increasing our working hours temporarily. I understand the dedication and hard work you consistently bring to the team, and I am reaching out to inquire if you would be willing to extend your workday to 15 hours for the next few weeks.

I want to emphasize that this request is not made lightly, and I am fully aware of the commitment it entails. Your contribution is immensely valued, and I believe that with your expertise and dedication, we can collectively overcome the current obstacles and successfully meet our monthly goals.

If you have any concerns or constraints regarding this request, please do not hesitate to discuss them with me. Your well-being and work-life balance are of utmost importance, and I want to ensure that we find a solution that works for both you and the team.

I appreciate your time and consideration in this matter. Your commitment to our shared goals is truly appreciated, and I am confident that, together, we can achieve the success we aim for.

Thank you for your understanding.
