Dear Iowa Department of Revenue,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Breech McDougal, and I am writing to discuss my current tax situation. I understand that I owe $2400 this year, but I would like to request a reconsideration of this amount based on my financial circumstances.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I am currently facing financial challenges that make it difficult for me to fulfill the entire tax obligation. I am fully committed to meeting my tax responsibilities and understand the importance of contributing to the state's revenue. However, I am wondering if we could work towards a more manageable figure that aligns with my current financial capacity.

After careful evaluation of my finances, I am proposing a revised amount of $1800 as a more feasible and reasonable sum for this year. I believe this adjustment would allow me to meet my tax obligations while addressing my current financial constraints.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my situation. If there is any additional information or documentation required to support this request, please let me know, and I will promptly provide it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to resolving this in an amicable and mutually beneficial manner.

Sincerely,

Breech McDougal
