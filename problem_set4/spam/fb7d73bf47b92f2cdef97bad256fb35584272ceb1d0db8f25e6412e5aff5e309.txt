Hey Becky,

Hope you're doing awesome! It's Flea here, the low-frequency enthusiast holding down the bass for our jams. I've been feeling the vibe, but there's a tiny tweak I've been thinking about.

Would you mind cranking up the bass a bit in the mix? I've got this feeling that a little extra thump could elevate our sound to the next level. You know how it is â€“ gotta make those basslines kick!

No rush, and I trust your ears on this. Just wanted to throw it out there and see if we can dial in that perfect groove. Let me know your thoughts when you get a chance.

Thanks a bunch, Becky!

Cheers,

Flea
