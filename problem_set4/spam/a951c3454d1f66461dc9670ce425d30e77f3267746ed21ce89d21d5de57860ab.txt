Hi Lee,

I hope you're having a good day! I wanted to ask if you could do me a small favor. There's a new bagel place near the office that everyone's been raving about, and I was wondering if you could pick up a dozen assorted bagels on your way home today. It would be greatly appreciated, and I'll make sure to reimburse you.

No rush, and if you have any questions or need more details, just let me know. Thanks a bunch!

Best,
Carlson
