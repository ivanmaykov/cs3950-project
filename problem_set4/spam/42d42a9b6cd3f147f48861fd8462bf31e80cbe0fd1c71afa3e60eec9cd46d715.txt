Dear Judge Newell,

I trust this letter finds you well. My name is Roper, and I am writing to request your understanding and consideration regarding my upcoming trial for larceny scheduled for December 19, 2023.

Unfortunately, I have encountered an unexpected and pressing family emergency that requires my immediate attention and presence. As the primary caregiver and support for my ailing [relationship], I am faced with a situation that demands my undivided attention and commitment.

Given these unforeseen circumstances, I am seeking your permission to be excused from the court proceedings related to my case on the scheduled trial date. I understand the importance of adhering to legal obligations and the court's schedule, and I deeply regret any inconvenience my absence may cause.

I assure you that I am committed to addressing the charges against me responsibly, and I am fully aware of the implications of my actions. It is with utmost sincerity that I request a brief postponement or alternative arrangement to allow me to attend to this family matter.

I am willing to provide any necessary documentation, such as medical records or statements, to verify the legitimacy of my situation. Additionally, I am prepared to cooperate fully with the court to reschedule my appearance at the earliest convenience for all parties involved.

I understand the gravity of the legal process, and I assure you that this request is made out of genuine necessity. I am grateful for your understanding and consideration of my circumstances.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your guidance and instructions on the best course of action.

Sincerely,

Roper
