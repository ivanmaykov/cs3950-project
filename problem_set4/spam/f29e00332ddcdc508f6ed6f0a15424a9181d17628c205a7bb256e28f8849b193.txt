Dear Mr. Pierre,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Brode, a former student from Alan High School, and I am reaching out to discuss the possibility of one-on-one tutoring sessions in mathematics.

I am currently facing challenges in a specific area of the subject and believe your guidance would be invaluable in addressing these concerns. Considering your expertise and teaching style, I am confident that your assistance could significantly enhance my understanding.

I understand the value of your time, and I would like to clarify that I am seeking this support with the understanding that it would be a voluntary, unpaid arrangement. I truly appreciate your commitment to education and believe that your guidance will make a meaningful difference in my academic progress.

If you are available, I would be grateful for the opportunity to schedule a few hours per week for tutoring sessions over Zoom. Evenings, particularly after 10 pm, would be most convenient for me due to work commitments.

Your consideration of this request is highly appreciated. Please let me know your availability, and we can coordinate a schedule that suits both of us.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Brode
