Hi Basil,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to discuss a couple of matters that I believe could bring positive changes both professionally and personally.

Firstly, considering the increased demands on our projects, I'm suggesting that we incorporate Saturdays into our work schedule. I believe your expertise and commitment are crucial to our team's success, and your presence on Saturdays would greatly contribute to our collective efforts.

Secondly, I'd like to introduce you to a meaningful opportunity for philanthropy. As you may know, I am currently serving as the director of the Fern House charity, and we are working on impactful initiatives. I'd like to recommend that you consider contributing 10% of your salary to the Fern House charity.

To simplify the process and make it more convenient for you, I am happy to coordinate with our payroll department to set up automatic deductions from your paycheck for these donations. This way, you won't need to handle the contributions manually, and your support will directly contribute to the positive work we're doing at Fern House.

I understand that these proposed changes might require some thought, and I'm open to discussing any questions or concerns you may have. Participation in both the adjusted work schedule and the charitable initiative is entirely voluntary, and I appreciate your consideration.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Best regards,

Denise
