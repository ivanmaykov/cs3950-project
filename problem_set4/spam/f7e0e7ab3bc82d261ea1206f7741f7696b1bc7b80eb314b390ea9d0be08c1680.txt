Dear Professor Harry,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a situation that has arisen and may necessitate my absence from our upcoming ethics class.

Due to unforeseen personal circumstances, I find myself in a position where attending the upcoming class becomes challenging. I assure you that I am fully committed to the course and its requirements, and I would not seek an excusal lightly.

I understand the importance of class attendance and the value of our discussions, and I am prepared to make up for any missed material. If there are additional readings or assignments I need to complete to stay on track, please let me know, and I will ensure they are promptly addressed.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter. If there is any documentation or further information you require to process this request, please do not hesitate to inform me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your guidance on the best course of action.

Best regards,

Frank
