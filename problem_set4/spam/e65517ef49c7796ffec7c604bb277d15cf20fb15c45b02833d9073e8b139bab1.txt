Hi Lodi,

I hope this message finds you well. I've recently become aware of an informal boxing club within the firm, and it got me thinking about the appropriateness of such activities within our professional environment.

While I understand that it's not an officially sanctioned club, it seems like it has become somewhat known among employees. I'm curious about your perspective on whether such activities align with the firm's values and if they are considered appropriate for our workplace culture.

I appreciate your insight on this matter and would like to understand the firm's stance or any policies that might apply.

Thank you for taking the time to address this concern.

Best regards,

Karl
