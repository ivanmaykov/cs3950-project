Hi Jackson and Mule,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to address a crucial matter concerning our team's financial structure that has recently come to light.

After thorough consideration and evaluation of our budget constraints, it has become apparent that we need to implement some adjustments to ensure the overall financial health of our team. Regrettably, this entails a temporary salary reduction of 20% for both of you over the next two years.

I understand that this news may come as a surprise, and I want to assure you that this decision was made after careful consideration of our team's long-term sustainability. The goal is to reallocate resources more effectively, ensuring the stability and growth of our team and creating a more secure foundation for all team members.

In the spirit of transparency, I also want to share that, as part of this financial realignment, I will be receiving a raise during this period. I recognize the impact this may have on both of you, and I want to emphasize that this measure is temporary. The plan is to reassess our financial standing in two years and, if circumstances permit, work towards restoring salaries to their previous levels.

I understand that this may be a challenging adjustment, and I am committed to supporting you during this time. If you have any concerns or if you would like to discuss this further, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Open communication is crucial, and I want to ensure that we can navigate through this period together.

I appreciate your understanding and flexibility in this matter. Your dedication to our team is invaluable, and I am confident that, with these temporary measures, we can position ourselves for a stronger future.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Elise
