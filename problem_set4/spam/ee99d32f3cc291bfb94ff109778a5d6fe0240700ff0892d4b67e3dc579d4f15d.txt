Hi Meg,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to address your recent concerns about the alleged underground boxing club meetings in the coffee room. I understand that this is a serious matter, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify.

I want to make it clear that I am currently working full-time remotely in a different state, and I have not been physically present at our office during the time frame in question. I am surprised and concerned to hear about these activities, and I want to assure you that I have had no involvement in any such incidents.

If there's any additional information you need or if there are steps we should take to investigate these matters further, please let me know. I value our professional relationship and am committed to maintaining a positive and respectful workplace environment.

I have cc'ed Lodi in this email for transparency, and I would appreciate any support or guidance you both can provide in resolving this issue.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to addressing this matter collaboratively.

Best regards,

Brianna
