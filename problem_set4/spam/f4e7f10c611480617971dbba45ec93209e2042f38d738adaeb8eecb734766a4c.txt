Hey Davel,

I hope your travels are going well! I've heard you're off to some exciting places, and I couldn't be happier for you. If it's not too much trouble, I was wondering if you could bring back a little piece of your adventures for me in the form of some local souvenirs.

Whether it's a keychain, postcard, or something unique to the place you're visiting, it would mean a lot to have a tangible reminder of the amazing experiences you're having. Of course, there's no rush, and I completely understand if your schedule is tight.

Safe travels, and can't wait to hear all about your adventures when you're back!

Best,
Surra
