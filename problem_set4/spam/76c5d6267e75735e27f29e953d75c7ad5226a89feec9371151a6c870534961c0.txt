Dear Supervisor Jones,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Evelyn Anderson, and I am writing to address a matter that has been weighing on my mind since last Wednesday.

I want to express my sincere apologies for arriving to work 30 seconds later than my usual punctual self. I understand the importance of adhering to our organizational schedule, and I am truly sorry for any inconvenience or disruption my brief tardiness may have caused.

To provide some context, there was an unexpected delay in the public transportation I rely on to commute to the office. Despite my best efforts to manage my time effectively, I encountered this unforeseen circumstance, resulting in my delayed arrival.

Please let me assure you that I am taking steps to prevent any future occurrences of this nature. I have adjusted my morning routine and explored alternative transportation options to ensure that I can uphold the punctuality standards we value at [Organization Name].

I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter. I understand the importance of our organizational culture, and I am committed to maintaining the high standards we set for ourselves.

If there are any additional measures or adjustments you recommend, please feel free to share them with me. I am eager to rectify this situation and prevent any future instances that may disrupt our workflow.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your guidance on how to move forward.

Best regards,

Evelyn Anderson
