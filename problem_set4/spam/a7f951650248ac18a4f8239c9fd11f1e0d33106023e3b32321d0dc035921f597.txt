Hi Meg and Alex,

I hope this message finds you both well. I wanted to follow up on the recent emails regarding concerns about activities in the coffee room. There have been reports that caught my attention, and I believe it's essential for us to address these matters promptly.

Meg, you mentioned some disruptive behavior, and Brianna has clarified that she is not physically present in the office due to remote work. I'm curious to know if you have any additional information or context about the alleged incidents in the coffee room.

Alex, if you have also observed or heard anything regarding these matters, your insights would be valuable in understanding the situation more comprehensively.

Maintaining a positive and professional workplace is crucial, and we should work collaboratively to address any concerns that may impact our office environment. Please feel free to share any details or observations you may have, and let's discuss how we can address this issue appropriately.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your cooperation in resolving it.

Best regards,

Lodi
