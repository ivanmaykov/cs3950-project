Hey Earl,

I saw you recently added a roast beef sandwich to the menu and I am stoked.  The fried chicken place down the street just went totally vegan, for some reason, and it's been harder to find meat around here.  Definitely going to be trying to roast beef at Earl's more often now!

Cheers,
Benji
