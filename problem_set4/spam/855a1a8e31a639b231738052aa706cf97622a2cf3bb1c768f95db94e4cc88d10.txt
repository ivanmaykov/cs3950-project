Dear Harmony Electronics Team,

I hope this email finds you in good spirits. My name is Alex Parker, and I am reaching out to inquire about the availability and pricing of a specific product that I am interested in purchasing.

The product in question is the "EcoCharge Solar Power Bank," a portable solar charger known for its efficiency and reliability. I am looking to purchase 10 units for a community project, and I am curious to know if this product is available in your inventory.

If it is available, could you kindly provide me with the unit price for the EcoCharge Solar Power Bank? Additionally, I am interested in any bulk purchase discounts or promotions that may apply to an order of 10 units.

I appreciate your prompt response to this inquiry, as it will assist me in making informed decisions for our community project.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Alex Parker
