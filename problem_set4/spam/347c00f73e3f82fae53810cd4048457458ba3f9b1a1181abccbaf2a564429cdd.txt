Hi Billy,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I find myself in need of some shift coverage at the bearing plant in September. Considering your experience and reliability, I was wondering if you might be available to cover a few shifts for me during that time.

I understand that schedules can be tight, so please feel free to let me know if this is something you'd be able to assist with. Your help would be greatly appreciated, and it would ensure a smooth operation during that period.

If you have any questions or need more details, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you in advance for considering my request.

Best regards,

Rhonda
