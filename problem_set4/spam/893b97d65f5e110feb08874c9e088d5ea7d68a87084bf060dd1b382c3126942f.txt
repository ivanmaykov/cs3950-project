Hi Loris,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss something that has been on my mind recently. I've noticed some behavior in the coffee room that has left me feeling disappointed, and I think it's important for us to address it.

In a professional setting, it's crucial that we maintain a respectful and considerate environment for everyone. Unfortunately, your recent antics in the coffee room have not aligned with these expectations. Whether it's loud conversations, untidy habits, or other actions that may be perceived as disruptive, it's important for us to be mindful of our behavior in shared spaces.

I believe we all contribute to creating a positive workplace culture, and your cooperation in maintaining a considerate environment would be greatly appreciated. If there's anything on your mind or any concerns you'd like to discuss, I'm more than willing to have an open conversation about it.

Let's work together to ensure that our shared spaces remain pleasant for everyone.

Best regards,

Meg
