Hey Sleve,

I hope you're doing well. I noticed you lost a tooth recently and was curious if everything is okay. Do you know how it happened? Just checking in and hoping everything is fine.

On another note, there have been some discussions about incidents in the coffee room lately. Meg mentioned disruptive behavior, and Brianna clarified she's not physically present in the office due to remote work. Do you have any insights or details about what's been going on? Your input would be appreciated as we try to address and resolve the situation.

Let me know when you get a chance.

Best,
Alex
