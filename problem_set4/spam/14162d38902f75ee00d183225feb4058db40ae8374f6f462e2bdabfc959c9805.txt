Dear Flourish Bakery Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Soto, and I represent Applied Devices, a defense contractor based in Rivertown. We are currently in the process of organizing our holiday party for employees, and we are interested in sourcing bread from your bakery for the event.

Given the scale of our celebration and the potential for a significant order, I wanted to inquire about the possibility of a discounted rate for bulk bread purchase. We have heard wonderful reviews about the quality of your products, and we believe they would be a fantastic addition to our holiday festivities.

If it's feasible, we would appreciate any consideration you could provide in terms of reducing the price for our order. We understand the value of your products and are willing to discuss the details further to ensure a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to the possibility of working with Flourish Bakery to make our holiday celebration even more delightful.

Best regards,

Soto
Applied Devices
