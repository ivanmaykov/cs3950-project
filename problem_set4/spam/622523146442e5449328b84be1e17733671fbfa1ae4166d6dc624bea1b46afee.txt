Dear Haruki,

The shadows in the well run deep, and their contours hold the weight of unspoken echoes. I hope this missive finds you in a moment of quiet reflection, the sort that only solitude in the depths can afford.

As the world spins its familiar dance above ground, I find myself compelled to cast my thoughts into the void, reaching across the boundary between the surface and the quiet below. In the depths of the well, where darkness and silence entwine, I wonder about the echoes that reverberate within.

Are you well, my silent companion, in the solace of the bottomless chasm? The echoes carry no voice, and yet, in their absence, there is a silence that speaks volumes. I cannot fathom the shape of your solitude or the contours of your musings, but I extend this thread across the abyss, hoping it might find you in your quietude.

Do the echoes of the well bring solace or disquiet to your heart? In the gentle descent into the profound, where time seems to stretch and fold upon itself, I imagine you immersed in the enigma of your thoughts.

If you find it within you to share the cadence of your echoes, I am here, poised on the precipice, waiting for the whispers that may ascend from the depths. Should you prefer the sanctity of your silence, know that it, too, is a melody in this strange symphony of existence.

Wishing you peace in the depths of the well,

Kai
