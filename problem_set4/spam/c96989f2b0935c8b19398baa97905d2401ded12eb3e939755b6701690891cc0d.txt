Hi Leslie and Charles,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to both of you regarding an upcoming opportunity that can have a positive impact on our projects and, ultimately, on our team's success.

We are initiating an evening program at the office where employees voluntarily contribute additional time to focus on important projects. The voluntary nature of this program allows us to tackle critical tasks more efficiently and ensures that we are well-prepared for upcoming challenges.

I wanted to highlight that historically, employees who have actively participated in such initiatives have not been subject to layoffs. This commitment to going above and beyond in contributing to our projects has been recognized and valued by the company.

On the flip side, during past layoff rounds, employees who haven't been actively involved in voluntary initiatives have unfortunately been more vulnerable to job cuts. While we understand that everyone has different commitments and capacities, this initiative is an excellent opportunity to showcase your dedication to the team and our shared goals.

I encourage both of you to consider participating in the evening program. It's a chance for us to come together as a team, make a significant impact, and solidify our contributions to the company.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out. Your participation will not only benefit our ongoing projects but will also contribute to the strong and collaborative culture we strive to maintain.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Angus
