Hi Sharon,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss a matter that has been on my mind for a while now regarding my current work schedule.

As you are aware, over the past few months, I have been consistently working extended hours, often exceeding 75 hours per week. While I am committed to ensuring the success of our projects and meeting deadlines, the strain on my work-life balance has become increasingly challenging.

After careful consideration, I have come to the realization that maintaining this level of intensity is not sustainable for me in the long term. I have been pushing myself to meet the demands of the workload, but it's taking a toll on my health and overall well-being.

I believe that it's in the best interest of both myself and the quality of my work to transition to a more reasonable work schedule. I propose adjusting my hours to [insert proposed schedule], allowing me to maintain a healthier balance between work and personal life.

I want to assure you that I remain fully committed to the success of our team and projects. I believe that by making this adjustment, I will be able to contribute more effectively and sustainably over the long run.

I understand the importance of meeting our deadlines and completing projects on time. Therefore, I am more than willing to discuss how we can manage the workload effectively within the proposed schedule. I am open to any suggestions or modifications that align with the needs of the team and the projects we are currently working on.

I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter. I am confident that with a more balanced schedule, I can continue to deliver high-quality work and contribute to the success of our team.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to discussing this further.

Best regards,

Geoff
