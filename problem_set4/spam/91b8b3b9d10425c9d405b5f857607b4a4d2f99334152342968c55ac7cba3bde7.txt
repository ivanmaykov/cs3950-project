Hi Rachel,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the deadline for the annual reports, I find myself in need of some extra support to ensure everything is on track. Given your expertise in this area, I was wondering if you could spare some time to help me with the finalization process.

I was thinking that meeting at 6 pm every night for the next few weeks might be a good way for us to collaborate efficiently. Your insights and assistance would be invaluable, and I believe working together will help us produce a comprehensive and polished set of annual reports.

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you or if you have any alternative suggestions. I greatly appreciate your willingness to assist, and I'm confident that our collaboration will lead to a successful outcome.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Cecil
