Dear Earl,

I trust this email finds you well. My name is Sean, and I am a regular customer at Earl's Sandwiches. I have always appreciated the quality and variety of your menu offerings.

I have a specific inquiry about your menuâ€”do you currently offer a roast beef sandwich? If so, I'd like to express a personal preference and suggest considering its removal from the menu.

While I understand that tastes vary, and this is purely a subjective matter, I believe that your establishment's menu could be enhanced by focusing on alternative selections that align with the diverse preferences of your patrons.

I value the attention to detail and commitment to customer satisfaction that Earl's Sandwiches consistently demonstrates, and I thought it appropriate to share this suggestion as a longtime customer.

I appreciate your consideration of this matter and look forward to continuing to enjoy the delicious offerings at Earl's Sandwiches.

Best regards,

Sean
