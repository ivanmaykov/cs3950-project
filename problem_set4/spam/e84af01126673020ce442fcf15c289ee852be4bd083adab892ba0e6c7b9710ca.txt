Hi Adrijan,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss a potential adjustment to our work schedule that would greatly contribute to the efficiency of our projects.

After reviewing our current workload and considering the upcoming demands on the team, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we adjust our working hours. Specifically, I'm proposing that we shift our start time to 5 am and work until midnight.

I understand that this is a significant change, and I want to assure you that I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't believe it would lead to improved productivity and better outcomes for our projects. The extended hours would provide us with additional time to focus on crucial tasks without feeling rushed, ultimately allowing us to deliver higher quality work.

I'd like to discuss this further with you to get your thoughts and see if there are any concerns or adjustments you'd like to propose. Flexibility is key, and I want to ensure that this proposed change aligns with your needs and preferences as well.

If you're open to this adjustment, we can schedule a meeting to work out the details and ensure a smooth transition. Your input is valuable, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us.

Thank you for considering this proposal, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.

Best regards,

Bruno
