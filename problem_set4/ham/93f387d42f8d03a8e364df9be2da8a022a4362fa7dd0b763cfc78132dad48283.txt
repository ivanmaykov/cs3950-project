Hi Paul,

I got your message and sorry it has taken me a few days to get back to you.  I wanted to be thorough, and you had a lot of points.  I attached a few things that should address your problem: look at the first couple of files and let me know if any of those instructions don't make sense. Otherwise, cricle back in a week or two and we can see how things are working out for you. This method works for other patients of mine so hopefully it works for you too.

Dr. Gibson
